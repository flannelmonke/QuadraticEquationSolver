##Quadratic equation solver
----------------------------
This quadratic equation solver was also developped by me and my teammate Mark.
In this calculator it gives two outputs of type double from three inputs using the quadratic formula.
x=((-b)Â±sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/2*a
------
If the input for both a and b are missing the calculator simply states.
"There is no equation"
--------
If the input for a is missing it will instead apply the formula x=(c/b)*-1
as a "Special Result"
